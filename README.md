# DT Coursework 2023 Toilet Seat
 In public bathrooms, a lot of the time people have problems with the cleanliness of toilet seats, because it is dirty from before, due to other users. Cleaning can also be an issue due to the fact that there's a lot of cleaning equipment required, and sometimes, due to storage issues, finding this cleaning equipment is difficult. Also installing high-tech components may be expensive, and is likely to be stolen. For this, I would like to create a solution that is easy to maintain, and at times allows for low human intervention. This product should simplify tasks to increase cleanliness as an approach and a mindset. I would like the product to also be lightweight, so that it is not cumbersome to install. As the product will be used in a washroom, it should be moisture resistant.
